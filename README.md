🧠 Face & Eye Detection with OpenCV
This project demonstrates real-time and static image-based face and eye detection using Haar cascade classifiers in OpenCV. It’s a great starting point for anyone exploring computer vision.

🚀 Features
Detects faces and eyes using pre-trained Haar cascade XML models

Supports both webcam feed and static image input

Converts input to grayscale for faster, more accurate detection

Highlights faces with yellow rectangles and eyes with orange rectangles

Displays the processed image in a pop-up window

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

Haar cascade XML files for face and eye detection

📦 Installation
pip install opencv-python
📂 Haar Cascade Files
Make sure you have the following XML files in your project directory:

haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

haarcascade_eye.xml
